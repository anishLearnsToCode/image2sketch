    "# Image 2 Sketch: A Novel Approach for Converting Images to Resemble Hand Drawn Sketches Using an Inverse Gaussian Feature Extraction Lattice Based Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I propose a novel method for converting a image (or video) into an image resembling a hand drawn sketch by an artist. There are several methods to acheieve this using Canny Edge Detection, Gaussian Blur Inversion and the basic txture convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We shall see below all these techniques and then introduce the Lattice Based ones which in my opinion give much more natural and seemingly human impressions. Creating a sketch or any other artform is highly subjetive and hence the results can't be tested using any metric, but rather the observr must be the judge of whether the results are good or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also introuce some control parameters that the user can vary to yeild the results that he/she wishes to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "The problem statement is simple. Given an image convert it into a hand drawn sketch such that it looks as if a human sketch artist drew it and the placing one generated by this algorithm, or one generated by an actual artist should be indiscerable, or rather act as a Turing Test for this algorith.\n",
